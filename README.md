# ArchLinux Hyprland Config Python

This is a CLI tool to manage my configs in an ArchLinux machine where the Window manager is Hyprland.

## Technologies used

For the construction of the CLI, I'm using [typer](hhtps://typer.tiangolo.com)

For testing, I'm using Pytest [![Pytest icon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/pytest/pytest-original-wordmark.svg)](https://docs.pytest.org)

## Inspiration

Some of the settings or ways of doing things I take them from the [ArcoLinux project](https://arcolinux.com)
